## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 8, Part 2

I liked this lab because it focused on making a math algorithm which got me relieved what I learned in math helped with coding alongside seeing it make a solution with given numbers.

* Lab 10, Part 2

It was nice using Text-driven development to make sifting through the amount of information manageable and make a "simpler" code so it wouldn't need to take a long time to code.

* Lab 7, part 2

I was genuinely happy with the algorithm to prove or disprove a date you give to it and time to tell you if it's available or not.
