## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 8, Part 2

I liked this lab because it focused on making a math algorithm which got me relieved what I learned in math helped with coding alongside seeing it make a solution with given numbers. But it did give me a bit of trouble in the beginning, the lecture halls certainly helped.

* Lab 10, Part 2

It was nice using Text-driven development to make sifting through the amount of information manageable and make a "simpler" code so it wouldn't need to take a long time to code. Though it was a pain to learn how to code it I'd say I did pretty well on it.

* Lab 7, part 2

I was genuinely happy with the algorithm to prove or disprove a date you give to it and time to tell you if it's available or not. But on the other hand It was a lot to code and figure out how everything worked and was put together, but id work on it again if given the chance because it was interesting to work on to say the least.
