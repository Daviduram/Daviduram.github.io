### CPSC 120

1. Lab 7

  * Lab 7 was a pretty nifty lab i took part in, even if it had one part to it. I managed to with a partner make a script to inform a person about designated times and dates of when a car can park. The if statments were pretty tricky but after a while I could tell the pattern.

2. Lab 10

  * Lab 10 proved to be quite intriguing as it introduced the concept of 2D vectors to determin population density which was horrible to try and solve. But I gradually grasped the code and understood the subject matter a little better. Despite the the initial confusion, I found satisfaction in completing the hard lab with any means I could.

3. Lab 8

  * While Lab 8 presented heaby frustation for me, second only to Lab 11, it was immensely rewarding to successfully get the averages int he make tests. The sense of accomplishment derived from overcoming the challenges to get the averages given was amazing. Despite the initial frustrations, the experience left a lasting impression on what to work on when it comes to coding.
