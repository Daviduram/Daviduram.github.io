### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

  Lab 12 was particularly enjoyable for me as it involved the application of sine and tangent functions, illustrating the practical relevance of calculus concepts. It reaffirmed my understanding that calculus isn't just theoretical but has real-world applications. This hands-on experience emphasized the necessity of applying mathematical principles in practical scenarios.

* Lab 10

  Lab 10 proved to be quite intriguing as it introduced the concept of 2D vectors, initially posing a challenge to comprehend. However, with the aid of the flowchart, I gradually grasped the intricacies and found clarity in understanding the subject matter. Despite the initial complexity, I found satisfaction in overcoming the hurdles and enhancing my comprehension of vector operations.

* Lab 8

  While Lab 8 presented significant frustration, second only to Lab 12, it was immensely rewarding to successfully validate command-line argument inputs and iterate through them in a loop. The sense of accomplishment derived from overcoming the challenges underscored the value of perseverance in problem-solving within the realm of command-line programming. Despite the initial frustrations, the experience left a lasting impression of satisfaction and growth in my programming skills.
