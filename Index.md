I am a Computer Science major at CSU Fullerton planning to graduate in 2027  

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 8, Part 2

I liked this lab because it focused on making a math algorithm which got me relieved what I learned in math helped with coding.

* Lab 10, Part 2

It was nice using Text-driven development to make sifting through the amount of information managable and make a "simpler" code.

* Lab 7, part 2

I was genuinely happy with the algorithm to prove or disprove a date you give to it and time to tell you ifs its avalible or not.
